# Regression_Project
The Regression Project for Stats class

Okay disregard the Test.Rmd, the Regression_Project.Rmd is the final draft, and has the third section beefed up, as well as the fourth section complete. 

Now both of you should be able to open the Regression_Project.Rmd file in RStudio, and then knit it to html to see the graphs and output of the code. Let me know if there are any difficulties.
